# object.freeze

> ES5 Sham

The `Object.freeze()` method freezes an object: that is, prevents new properties from being added to it; prevents existing properties from being removed; and prevents existing properties, or their enumerability, configurability, or writability, from being changed, it also prevents the prototype from being changed. The method returns the passed object.
