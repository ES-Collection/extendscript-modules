# AES.PATCH scope
This is a collection of polyfills for [ExtendScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtendScript). Later editions of ECMAScript bring some useful new scripting features, and since they're syntactically compatible with older JavaScript engines they can mostly be polyfilled by patching methods onto built-in JS objects.

  * [`shim`](./shim/README.md)
  * [`sham`](./sham/README.md)
  * [`fill`](./fill/README.md)

> We prefer to use polyfills [from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) when available. ([Discussed here](https://github.com/ExtendScript/extendscript-es6-shim/issues/1))
