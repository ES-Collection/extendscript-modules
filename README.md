# ExtendScript Modules

Here you can find some [modules](./docs/API-Registry.md) we host inside our [@extendscript](https://www.npmjs.com/org/extendscript) namespace on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). These modules create a [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) package environment targeting the ExtendScript environment. Giving the flexibility to pick and choose implemetations and share reusable code.
