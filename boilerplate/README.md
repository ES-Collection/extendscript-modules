# Boilerplates

Some lightweight boilerplates...

## Create a Module

Kick off a [new module](./module) to contribute to this Library.

## Create an App

Start a [new project](https://github.com/ExtendScript/extendscripter-boilerplate) using the modules. Keep in mind that you want contribute a module as well. The best applications consist mostly of a compilation of modules. We like push-ups!
