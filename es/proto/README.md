# ExtendScript prototypes
This is a collection of prototypes for [ExtendScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtendScript) hosted on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/extendscript).

## What is a prototype?
Prototypes add new methods to existing object constructors

> Generally you only want to modify your own prototypes. However when loading a shim it makes sense to update a standard javascript object.
