# ExtendScript shims
This is a collection of shims for [ExtendScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtendScript) hosted on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/extendscript). These `shims` only returns mocks giving you the freedom to load the shim in any way you see fit.

## What is a shim?
Shims are modules that bring new ECMAScript features to the ExtendScript environment.
