# API Registry
To not pollute the global scope, it is recommended to attach methods to a shared global variable. We keep a registry of properties that might be loaded into the shared API called `myApp`.

    $.myApp

  - Properties in _italic_ do not exist but are reserved for users
  - Properties in __bold__ are open for sub methods (preferred)
  - The registry is case-insensitive
