# ruler.set

> InDesign Utility

The `ruler.set()` method sets both rulers to the desired units. It returns the original ruler-settings which we can pass back to reset the rulers to original state.

## Install

    npm install @extendscript/aes.ind.util.ruler.set

## Test

You can test the code against a range of [targets](https://github.com/nbqx/fakestk/blob/master/resources/versions.json):

    npm run test target-1 target-2

We keep [a log of test results](./test/results_log.md)
